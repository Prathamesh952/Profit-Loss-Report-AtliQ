1)A clear Objective / Goal: explain what problem this P&L & performance report solves. Eg. “Provide consolidated financial & sales performance analysis for AtliQ to help business decisions.”

2)List of Input data: what raw data (csv, excel, database) was used to generate these PDFs. This helps others understand context or re-generate the report if needed.

3)High-level Key insights: for instance, “Customer X accounts for 30% of revenue”, “Market A underperformed relative to target by 15%”, “Profit margin increased over years Y → Z”, etc.

4)How to replicate / workflow: steps or tools (Excel, Power Query, Python scripts, etc.) used — especially useful if someone wants to update or rerun reports.

5)Usage & Audience: for whom these reports are meant — management, investors, internal audits, stakeholders.

6)Maybe a short “Limitations / Assumptions”: e.g. data quality, missing data, assumptions about fiscal calendar, etc.

7)Future work / Enhancements: possibility to add dashboards, visualizations (graphs, charts), automated generation, dynamic reports, etc.
